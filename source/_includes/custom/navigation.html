 	Hi, I'm Arnaud and you're visiting my personnal blog. I'm glad you're here. I'm an engineer,  I have notable experience in Data Integration especially programming efficient ETL jobs and disecting several "CDC" softwares. I spent many years designing high volume datawarehouse applications with different RDBMS, sometimes column oriented stores and less actively document-oriented DB. Ironically, this weblog is 100% static, h√©.<br />I'm also very curious of any technology I don't know about especially web-app related. I try hard improving my skills. If you willing to give me the chance to do it at your company, or just for any purpose, feel free to send me an email at
